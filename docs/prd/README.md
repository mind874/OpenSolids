# OpenSolids PRD

The working PRD for MVP is captured in the planning conversation and reflected by:

- core API: `osl.material`, `Material.<property>(T)`, `osl.search`, `osl.list_providers`
- three providers: `nist-cryo`, `ntrs`, `mil-hdbk-5`
- offline data packs with manifest/material/source records
- provenance-first records with compliance notes
